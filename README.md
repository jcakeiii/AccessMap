# AccessMap 

Thu (Jackie) Le - Senior Project

## Summary

The DePauw University campus, like many other college campuses, is expansive and consists of 36 buildings across 695 acres. Therefore, navigating through the campus can be challenging, especially for people with physical disabilities. While DePauw does make an effort to make its infrastructure accommodating to those with disabilities, these features might not be obvious or easy to find, resulting in difficulties getting around campus. Many students have reported having difficulty finding accommodations for their needs on campus. 
AccessMap is a web application designed to assist users in navigating the accessibility features at DePauw University. The website offers a detailed map of each building’s accessibility options, with markers highlighting key amenities such as elevators, ramps, and automatic doors. Each marker represents the relative location of the feature in the building and comes with brief descriptions, pictures, and reviews. AccessMap’s database is crowdsourced, relying on the DePauw community to upload information on available amenities. When accessing AccessMap, users can search the building they want to learn more about and click on a marker to see pictures of the feature, available descriptions, reviews, and ratings. Users can submit information to add another accessibility feature to the map, as well as descriptions and reviews for each accessibility feature, to enhance the map.
